My name is Huey Yun Teo. You can call me HY and I hail from the sunny islands of Singapore. My vices (or interests) include but are not limited to soccer, cats and old films. I live on the philosophy of action, where I believe knowledge (learned through books or texts) are best accompanied by action and experience.

I'm currently working for [KISI](http://getkisi.com/ "KISI") as a Content Marketer. Interested in working with me? Find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nicothyun "HY on Twitter") or send me an email at nico.thyun@gmail.com.
