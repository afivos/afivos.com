Iâ€™m Fivos, a multidisciplinary designer on a mission to learn as much as possible about design, its applications, its potential and its limitations (if any). I'm currently doing an MA in Design at Goldsmiths University of London focusing on Spaces and Participation.

Prior to this, I have primarily worked as a web/user interface designer both as a freelancer as well as within startup teams of designers and software engineers.
