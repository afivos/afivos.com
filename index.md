My name is Fivos Avgerinos and I'm a designer from Athens. I have a passion for interaction design, typography, simplicity and minimal aesthetics. And traveling. Like, as much as possible.

I'm currently working for [BigStash](http://bigstash.co/ "BigStash") as a User Interface Designer. However, I always manage to find time for various [side projects](http://dribbble.com/afivos "Fivos Avgerinos on Dribbble"). Interested in working with me? Find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/afivos "Fivos Avgerinos on Twitter") or send me an email at afivos@me.com.
