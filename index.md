My name is Fivos Avgerinos and I'm a designer with a passion for the web, typography, simplicity and clean aesthetics. And [traveling](http://instagram.com/afivos "Fivos Avgerinos on Instagram").

During the past couple of years, I was a User Interface Designer at Longaccess in Athens. I'm currently working on various freelance projects and I'm available for new opportunities.
