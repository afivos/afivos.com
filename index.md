My name is Fivos Avgerinos and I'm a creative from Athens, Greece with a passion for the web, interaction design and typography. I'm into simplicity and minimal aesthetics. Oh and traveling!

I'm currently working for [BigStash](http://bigstash.co/ "BigStash") as a User Interface Designer. In addition to that, I work on various side projects. I also spend a lot of time thinking about and planning my next backpacking trip.

Interested in working on a side project with me? Check out some more of my work on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/afivos "Fivos Avgerinos on Dribbble"), find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/afivos "Fivos Avgerinos on Twitter") or send me an email at <a href="mailto:me@afivos.com">me@afivos.com</a>.
