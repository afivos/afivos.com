Fivos Avgerinos is a designer and developer working within and around the boundaries of interaction and user experience design. Most of his work thus far has been primarily related to user interface design and front end development.

Fivos is currently doing an MA in Design at Goldsmiths University of London, focusing on Spaces and Participation. He is on a mission to learn as much as possible about design, its applications, its potential and its limitations, if any.
