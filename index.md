My name is Huey Yun Teo. You can call me HY and I hail from the sunny island of Singapore. I'm **currently working for KISI as a Content Marketer**.

I believe in the power of narratives and storytelling. I have always been surrounded by books, comics or films. Brands fascinate me in a similar way; I like to dig into the core messaging of a company and [narrate their stories through digital and physical means]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume). 

 My vices (or interests) include but are not limited to soccer, cats and old films. I live on the philosophy of action, where I believe knowledge (learned through books or texts) are best accompanied by action and experience.

 Interested in working with me? Find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nicothyun "HY on Twitter") or send me an email at nico.thyun@gmail.com.
