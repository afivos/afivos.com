Ok, let's be frank. This is an *attempt* at starting a blog. Having failed miserably in similar attempts in the past (diaries, journals), now know better! I'm **not** saying I'm going to commit this time. It's **not** going to be my next year's resolution. I **won't** be writing something at least once a week.

I'm simply starting this blog because I feel the need to write. Generally. To write about design, about working at a startup, about my life back in Athens after four years studying in the UK, about traveling...

Nonetheless, I have high hopes for it this time. Let's see how it goes.
