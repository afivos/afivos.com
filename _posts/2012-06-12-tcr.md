Before matriculating to college, I worked six months as an intern for a film and video production company, The Creative Room, in Singapore. In the first month, I felt like an awkward duck; I was the only and first intern that they have hired without a diploma or institutionalized training in film and video production. I knew nothing. I was the proverbial duck in the ocean.

And so goes my adventure - the six months saw me immersing myself in the world.  We had overnight shoot where we blocked the highway traffic, we crawled down the subway underground, we [went into the forest to shoot a music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFDvmyGtekQ&ab_channel=TheSamWillows){:target="_blank"}, we shot in local art museums and [local creatives' houses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml-2TpFlKzE&ab_channel=ObjectifsFilmsSG){:target="_blank"} and we had [international bartenders mixing and making cocktails and spirits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfocvGrgOZQ&list=PLJC89mwp5tNplMArokUFvVgR55ch-X4wZ&ab_channel=DiageoBarAcademy){:target="_blank"} for bar academy training videos (I swear I never got to drink any of the cocktails - the director refused to let me so; said I looked like a kiddo.) and ...

I learnt and observed a lot: from location racking to post-production editing to how people handle their mood at their crankiest (think overtime production shoot) and to listening to the camera crew chirpily share their technicalities. But it also taught me a lot about my self and the whole experience wouldn't have been so enriching without all the help from the crew, who had guided me so much along the way.
