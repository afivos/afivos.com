headline:   During my internship at Studio INI, I helped prototype the installation that represented Greece at the 2018 London Design Biennale, at Somerset House.

Very briefly, ΑΝΥΠΑΚΟΗ is a 17-metre-long kinetic wall constructed from a steel spring skeleton built up with recycled plastic. It flexes, morphs and breathes around the human body.

It is designed around the idea of *disobedience*, with the wall breaking the archetype of a static architectural pavilion by moving and modulating its shape. The public are invited to participate in a mood of creative disobedience by transitioning from an obedient spectator to a disobedient actor, physically passing through the wall along an undulating walkway.

It is not influenced by the destructive nature of the word but rather by how disobedience can be harnessed for debate, creativity and progress, drawing from Greek mythology such as the myths of Icarus, Antigone and Prometheus.

I joined <a href="http://www.nassia-inglessis.com">Studio INI</a> when a rough, functional prototype of the installation had already been developed. My tasks involved testing it and finding ways to improve it.

During my internship, I was involved with making, prototyping and dealing with suppliers to source and work with various materials such as architectural fabrics, metals and ultimately (recycled) engineering plastics.

Thank you Nassia and Ed for having me on your team during these past few months, working on such an exciting project for the <a href="http://www.londondesignbiennale.com">2018 London Design Biennale</a>.
