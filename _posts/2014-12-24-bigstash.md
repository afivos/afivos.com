This poker card set consists of 54 cards (Including 2 Jokers) where they are packed and printed in clear plastic box. It was a pet project born out of my Whovian love.

 I created them during the semester break where I first illustrated the designs using colour pencils and watercolour, scanned and then touched them up on Photoshop. Over the school term, I sourced for various card manufacturing suppliers to print them in limited batches. 

2.5 inches x 3.5 inches
54 pcs, 270gsm
