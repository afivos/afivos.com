**Update:** [BigStash has shut down](http://blog.bigstash.co/2015/07/03/bigstash-is-shutting-down/?utm_source=letters+from+vrypan&utm_campaign=68add8b37c-150723_letter_012&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_267015b10c-68add8b37c-117994697).

BigStash.co was the largest, most complex and most important project I have worked on so far. It was a platform enabling people to store files they rarely use. The idea was to design an extremely simple and elegant interface that would camouflage all the complexities of the backend, creating the perfect experience from onboarding, to everyday engagement with the platform. In doing so, I collaborated closely with the software engineers at Longaccess throughout the process. I designed a minimal, fully responsive interface, enabling people to use it instinctively. I embraced both positive and negative feedback in an attempt to perfect my work as the project kept involving continuously.
