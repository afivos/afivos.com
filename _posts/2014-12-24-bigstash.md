This poker card set consists of 54 cards (Including 2 Jokers) where they are packed and printed in clear plastic box. It was a pet project born out of my Whovian love.

 I created them during the semester break where I first illustrated the designs using colour pencils and watercolour, scanned and then touched them up on Photoshop. Over the school term, I sourced for various card manufacturing suppliers to print them in limited batches. 

2.5 inches x 3.5 inches
54 pcs, 270gsm

I did not design this awesome acorn logo. [Stavros Kypraios](https://dribbble.com/shots/1922657-BigStash-icon?list=users&offset=1 "Logo by Stavros Kypraios") did. However, I designed the BigStash landing page, web app and total user interface. This is my most thorough and most important work to date and I'm really proud of it!
