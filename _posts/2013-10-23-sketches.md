**Update:** Longaccess has shut down.

longaccess.com was the first project I got involved with at Longaccess. It was also my first large-scale web related project. Apart from the website and the overall user experience, I was involved with all design related material. We needed to create an infographic to communicate the process of storing data in our platform, to our stakeholders.

Upon deciding on the steps we needed to show, I made the sketches depicted, turned them into digital illustrations and created various infographics that were later used in other parts of the Longaccess experience such as posters, presentations, banner ads and the actual website among others.
