#Sample Post H1

This is a sample post written in markdown. __Markdown on Save Improved__ will ensure that when this post is saved, it will retain its syntax.

##Markdown Items (H2)

Writing Markdown is extremely simple, but incase you have problems you can read about the syntax of Markdown [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdon: Syntax"), or read a useful cheat sheet [here](http://support.mashery.com/docs/customizing\_your\_portal/Markdown\_Cheat\_Sheet "Markdown Cheat Sheet")

###Lists

####Unordered

- An unordered list is super simple.
- Just use a dash, esterisk, or plus sign.
* You can even mix and match.
+ Not that you would want to.

####Ordered

1. Numbers.
2. Just numbers.
3. As simple as that.

####Definition List

List Defined
: A number of connected items or names written or printed consecutively, typically one below the other.
Item Defined
: An individual article or unit, esp. one that is part of a list, collection, or set.

###Emphasis

####Italic

_Italicising text_ is easy and can be *done* a couple of different ways.

####Bold

__Bolding text__ is also easy and can be **done** a couple of different ways as well.

###Escaping

Escaping some symbols is required to make sure that Markdown doesn't interpret them as one of its own. These characters include \\`\*\_\{\}\[\]\(\)\#\+\-\.\!\:\|

<small>Note: The good thing about markdown is that it also supports standard HTML. Oh, and you don't have to escape periods all of the time. So you ended a sentence with, "in 1984 PERIOD". Well, you would want to escape that period, like "in 1984\." so that Markdown doesn't interpret this as a list item.</small>
