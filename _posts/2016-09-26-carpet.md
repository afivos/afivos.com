When I’m done designing a site in Sketch, it’s time to turn it into code. Luckily, I’m equally passionate about both designing and coding.

I always struggle starting off, though. For more than a couple of years, I didn't have a foundation for every new site. There was no basis to begin with. I would simply duplicate my last project’s folder and start editing all the files. The idea was that nothing could possibly be as up-to-date so of course that should be my starting point. It was a mess, I’m telling you!

As I have grown as a designer, I now try to avoid third-party frameworks and build my own foundation. I also wanted to have an extremely simple starting point, easily expandable and adaptable to all future projects.

So, I built [Carpet](/carpet). It is nothing more than my currently preferred Sass structure consisting of a directory for code that doesn’t cause Sass to actually output CSS (`modules`), a directory where the meat of my CSS is constructed (`partials`), and a directory for third-party CSS (`vendor`).

I decided to give it a name, upload it on Github and give it substance, so that I will stick to the plan this time and build my next sites using a "solid foundation" that I would work on and update as a separate project.

Hopefully, you will find it as useful as I do. Suggestions are more than welcome.
