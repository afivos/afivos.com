There's no argument that the super-wide angle look makes photos look amazing. In fact, I've been wanting to be able to have that field of view ever since I got into photography 5 years ago.

Buying a fisheye lens for my Canon 550D was a rather expensive option but I recently got myself a GoPro Hero4 Silver to do the job. Not quite the same image quality but oh well.

I went to Skyros (a beautiful Greek island) for the weekend and my friend [Michael](https://500px.com/mickaz) brought his Sigma 15mm 2.8 Fisheye lens. We ended up taking awesome photos with his Canon 6D and my Canon 550D along with the GoPro. Lots of fisheye photos.

Specifically, I liked this one he took of me with his Sigma lens:

I wanted to use it as my main website photo but after looking at it for a while I got tired of the effect. I guess there's times that fisheye can simply be too much.

So, I ended up finding out about the **Adaptive Wide Angle** filter in Photoshop. I was under the impression that editing a photo to remove such an effect would ultimately ruin it.

However, after playing with it for a couple of minutes by adding some horizontal and vertical lines using the **Constraint Tool**, here's what I ended up with:

I don't know about you but I think it looks much better now. I've tweaked the colors, too!
