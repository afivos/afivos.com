BigStash was the main platform I got involved with during my two-year Lead Designer role at Longaccess. It was a platform enabling people to store files they rarely use. The idea was to design an extremely simple and elegant interface that would camouflage all the complexities of the backend, creating the perfect experience from onboarding, to everyday engagement with the platform.

In doing so, I collaborated closely with Software Engineers throughout the process. I designed a minimal, fully responsive interface, enabling people to use it instinctively. I embraced both positive and negative feedback in an attempt to perfect my work as the project kept involving continuously.

<!--Even though the platform does not exist anymore, I have uploaded some static pages on a subdomain to showcase the design: [bigstsh.afivos.com](bigstash.afivos.com).-->
