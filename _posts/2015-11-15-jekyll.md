Hi, I was bored and my boredom saw the light of this.

I also felt like I needed an online site where I could host my works and projects. I considered using Wordpress. After all, I am working in marketing where Wordpress is the industry standards and touted CMS, championed by veteran marketers.

Squarespace was another alternative. Its a drag and drop and interface and I have used it but the lack of customizability made me sad. With Squarespace, you can't go down to the nitty gritty and even in Developer Mode, its FTP server files was sad. You can't access them. I didn't like both of the workflow  of Wordpress and Squarespace CMS.

And plus Github is free. (I didn't have to deal with web host pricing and services.) So I spent the weekend reading on how-tos, trying out Jekyll, working on it locally and than pushing it to Github.

And viola, here's my baby. Its still a work in progress. I haven't uploaded all my projects and I am trying to learn how to tag the posts and pages. I want to use tags on the projects to filter them by skills. But this is a start. :)
