I manage the KISI Blog where I work with the Marketing Manager to develop and iterate its content calendar and strategy.

My weekly responsibilities include guest blogging outreach, editing and creating interactive media (gifs, static graphic, videos etc.) for each post.

Working in a lean marketing team, my weekly duties also include content distribution and promotion via influencer marketing, targeted and main social media platforms and email direct newsletter.

Aside from managing and editing the blog content, sometimes I write their articles.
