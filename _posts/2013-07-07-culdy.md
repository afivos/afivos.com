I was hired by Dimitris Savvopoulos, a web developer creating his own, open source Content Management System to come up with a brand name and logo that would be simple and elegant to reflect the intuitiveness of his project. After research, I came up with “culdy”, a five-letter, easy-to-pronounce word ending in a hyphen, with a .com domain name available.

I decided to make a logo from scratch. I drew multiple versions, selected the one I thought worked best and converted it to vector using Sketch. The 6 steps depict the process from tracing and drawing the necessary parts all the way to finalising the logo by connecting each letter with a ligature.

Being a typography enthusiast, this project has given me inspiration to maybe one day create my very own font.
