I finally found the time to update my personal website.

That's happened quite a few times in the past couple of years since I started getting into web design. You can track my progress by visitng previous versions of the website at [old.afivos.com](http://old.afivos.com). Try adding /1 (first version), /2, /3 and so on, until there's nothing there. At the moment of writing, there's 7 older versions of the current one.

So yeah, I've been trying to find the ideal way to blog. After doing some searching and researching [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) seemed like the way to go. Admittedly, it took me a while to set it up but now that it's up and running, it couldn't be easier to update or publish a new blog post. However, I decided not to host it on Github Pages (which lots of cool kids seem to be doing) for two reasons: firstly, I had to somehow hack my way out of Github not allowing custom Jekyll plugins and secondly, I wanted to use my custom domain, without screwing my custom email, while still being able to update the rest of my subdomains via FTP. There's probably ways to do all of that but hey, I'm new to this.

Consequently, I'm back to square one ragarding the updating process. I generate my site locally and then drag and drop everything to the server via FTP. <strike>Still trying to find the ideal way to have my `_site/` directory pushed to the server via git. Suggestions on this are more than welcome.</strike> **Update:** ["Updating my site with a simple command"](/2015-06-11-updating-my-site-with-a-simple-command).

As far as the design goes, I wanted it to be clean as well as easy and pleasant to read and navigate around. That's definitely a never-ending process.

Last but not least, I've been heavily influenced by [Daniel Eden's](https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me) and [Matthew Kosloski's](https://github.com/MatthewKosloski/site) websites. Thanks guys for open sourcing your great work. It has taught me a lot.
