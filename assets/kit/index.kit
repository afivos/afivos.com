			<h2 class="title">Leeds Children's Charity</h2>

			<p>Every year, around 400 underprivileged children from Leeds are given a much needed holiday from difficult home lives and tough family circumstances. They get the opportunity to enjoy playing, make new friends and focus on being children, away from the pressures they face day-to-day. The LCC has been providing and caring for these children since 1904.</p>

			<p>I was commissioned by Fat Beehive to design a new website for the LCC that reflects this important work: a site that gives families, schools and financial supporters a central, online point of reference, giving them all the information they need about the LCC.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Welcome</h2>
			
			<p>Most NGO websites focus on fundraising efforts and it is often challenging for clients to find the resources they need. Welcome is the International Rescue Committee's client-facing site.</p>
			
			<p>I led design, developed personas, mapped out user journeys, produced wireframes and created high-fidelity designs and prototypes. I collaborated closely with stakeholders from various departments within the IRC such as researchers, developers and people working directly with clients. Welcome now helps our clients find the information they need before, during, or after their resettlement process in an accessible way.</p>
